## This project aims to predict heart failure based on the dataset "heart_failure_clinical_records_dataset.csv". I display relationships using bar graphs, histograms, and a correlation matrix. I trained a machine learning model using the following variables:

#### Independent variables
Used the following variables for the ML model because of their significant correlation to Death Event: 
Age, Serum Creatinine, Serum Sodium, Time

Eliminated the following variables from the ML model due to its weak correlation to Death Event: 
Anaemia, Sex, Diabetes, Smoking Status, High Blood Pressure

#### Dependent
Measured the following variable: Death Event

#### Classifiers
Trained the data to build the following ML Classifiers: Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest
